let's start working on a new chart/visualization type - horizontal comparison. We'll work on several fields from
the dataset at a time. Let's call first field 'versions'. Typically there'll be just 2 distinct values across all rows in
this field. If not, we'll repeat the process for every pair. Second field will be 'metrics'. For each 'metric', there'll
be a row in the output. The third field is 'value'. It is an optional field and can be aggregated. This is how we'll
determine the difference. 

Let's start with looking at difference only, and get confidense interval in the next iteration.

Let's look at the example.

model_id,input_size,latency,score
A,128,10,10
A,256,18,9
A,512,31,11
B,128,12,15
B,256,25,17
B,512,55,13

let's say we call 

cat data.csv | uplt cmp model_id input_size score

model_id becomes 'versions' field
input_size becomes 'metrics' field
score is 'value'

We'll need to show something like this (without -v):

   | A score | B score | diff
128| 10      | 15      | -5 (- 33%)
256| 9       | 17      | -8 (- 47%)
512| 11      | 13      | -2 (- 15.3%)
